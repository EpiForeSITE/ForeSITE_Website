  description: The purpose of this project is to easily distribute a capability of time series statistical alerts to analysts in public health. While software tools such as these usually require a software developer or statistician, the aim is to provide an easy-to-use solution so that analysts in STLT Health Departments can leverage these with their current capacities.
