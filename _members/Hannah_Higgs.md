Hannah Higgs, Regulatory Coordinator. Ms Higgs organizes and coordinates all components of research study, including IRB approval, amendments, and renewals, as well as preparation of reports, project management methodology, maintaining study documentation, and scheduling team and other study-related meetings. Ms Higgs has rich experience with large cohort studies and managing large data/modeling focused programs with multiple component projects. She has years of experience working with these investigators on CDC funded programs under multiple funding mechanisms including SHEPheRD, MInD, and Epicenter. Most recently, she has managed the SHEPheRD program that analyzed large data sets from multiple sources including the VA, state public health, and publicly available data. Notably, all deliverables were submitted on time for the SHEPheRD program, in large part due to her support. Her rapport and trust that she has built with the team of investigators on this proposal will facilitate an effective working environment and contribute to the success of this program.
