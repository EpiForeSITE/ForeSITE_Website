Dr. Schwartz combines experimental and theoretical research techniques to investigate mechanisms in virology, immunology, and infectious disease epidemiology. Her team uses quantitative methods and computer modeling in conjunction with data in order to predict unforeseen biological mechanisms, to determine biologically important rate parameters, and to evaluate pathogenic mechanisms that are difficult to test directly. This interdisciplinary approach, which couples mathematics with experiments, aims to advance our basic understanding of disease mechanisms and to lead to new therapeutic strategies.
