I am an Assistant Professor of Research at the [Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/epidemiology/). I work on studying [Complex Systems](https://cssociety.org/about-us/what-are-cs) using
[Statistical Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics). I have over
ten years of experience developing scientific software focusing on high-performance
computing, data visualization, and social network analysis. My training is in Public
Policy (M.A. [UAI](https://www.uai.cl/), 2011), Economics (M.Sc. [Caltech](https://caltech.edu), 2015), and
Biostatistics (Ph.D. [USC](https://usc.edu), 2020).
