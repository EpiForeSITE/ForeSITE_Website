Damon Toth, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in The Research Track in the Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics. As an applied mathematician, his research interests include mathematical modeling and simulation of the spread of infectious diseases. Dr. Toth’s research accomplishments include major contributions to the Final Supplementary Risk Assessment for the Boston University National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL). His ongoing work includes network and transmission modeling for the CDC-sponsored Contacts among Utah’s School-age Population (CUSP) project, modeling of the infection and transmission of Clostidium difficile in hospitals, and modeling of dose-response, incubation period, and transmission of infectious pathogens for use in risk analysis and outbreak prediction and surveillance. Dr. Toth received his PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington. He received post-doctoral training in the Mathematical Biology group in the University of Utah’s Department of Mathematics.
