Elizabeth Weybright is an Associate Professor and Adolescent Extension Specialist in the Department of Human Development at Washington State University. Grounded in prevention science and systems theory, her research focuses on adolescent health promotion and prevention. This spans a) basic research on topics such as youth behavior (e.g, rural youth firearm engagement) and leisure experiences (e.g., boredom, motives); b) dissemination, adaptation, and implementation of substance use prevention and positive youth development programs; and c) building capacity among professionals and systems for delivery of evidence-based approaches for health promotion and prevention. An evolving line of research is around Health Extension and using the Extension network and related strengths to more effectively deliver community care in rural areas to address health inequities.
