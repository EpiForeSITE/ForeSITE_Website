Dr. Lofgren is an infectious disease epidemiologist whose research focuses on the use of mathematical and computational models of disease transmission, particularly the transmission of antimicrobial resistant infections within and outside healthcare settings, as well as emerging infectious diseases. His work often focuses on producing policy-relevant results, working hand-in-hand with clinicians and policy makers to produce reproducible, quantitative guidance for designing and evaluating public health interventions.
