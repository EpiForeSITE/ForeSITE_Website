Dr. Rubin has clinical expertise in infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology, with a specific focus on preventable infections acquired from interactions with the health care setting. In particular, he is interested in infections caused by organisms resistant to multiple antibiotics (or, "multidrug-resistant organisms"), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. Although he specializes in the treatment of these types of infections, he also provides expertise in preventing these infections through the promotion of various infection control measures, such as strict adherence to handwashing, early removal of invasive devices, consistent use of contact isolation practices, and appropriate use of antibiotics.
