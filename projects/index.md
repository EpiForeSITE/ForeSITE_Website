ForeSITE aims to develop and implement a library of modeling and analytic tools belonging to five toolsets:
automated alerting, parameter estimation, scenario planning, forecasting/nowcasting, and
economic impact analysis. We will establish a flexible, sustainable, practical, and replicable modeling infrastructure for a
broad range of settings, including local health departments in rural locations, which have limited
access to analytical support.
