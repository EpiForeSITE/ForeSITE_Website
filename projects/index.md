ForeSITE aims to develop and implement a library of modeling and analytic tools belonging to three toolsets:
Anomaly Detection & Forecasting/Nowcasting, parameter estimation & Scenario Modeling, and
Economic Impact Analysis. We will establish a flexible, sustainable, practical, and replicable modeling infrastructure for a
broad range of settings, including local health departments in rural locations, which have limited
access to analytical support. Below, we have included a sampling of our ongoing efforts.
